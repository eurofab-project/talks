Morphometric classification homogenisation protocol

## Protocol design
1. Use morphometric classification of Central Europe from a parallel research project as ground truth data
2. Calculate morphometric characters on subpar, but homogenous and widely available data, using enclosed tessellation cells (ETCs) as the base unit of analysis

## Protocol design
3. Train a supervised model to predict the classification of ETCs directly from the calculated morphometric characters, using the morphometric classification data as a target label

## Protocol design
4. Test the model on an out of training sample country to validate the approach.
    - For example, train the model on Poland, Germany, Austria, Slovakia and test it on Czechia.


## Input data collection and preprocessing

1. Morphometric classification of Central Europe (UPDATE)
2. Microsoft Building footprints (UPDATE)
4. Implementation ( UPDATE )


## Detailed morphometric classification
- New iteration of the hierarchical classification, based on feedback from stakeholders.
- Available as a web app (https://uscuni.org/himoc/).
- Naming of clusters and branches will be based on stakeholder feedback

## Microsoft Building footprints
- There is a cache of previous data for Central Europe in the Planatery Computer Stack API
- We are exploring if it might improve model performance if we add it to the pipeline.

---

## Current implementation status
1. The core functionality for the pipeline was made available within open-source packages - `momepy`, `libpysal`, `neatnet` and the project itself is a public repository.
2. We replaced the previous iteration of target labels with the new ones.
3. Added the capability to calculate spatially lagged variables for the whole dataset.

# Model development

---

## First full model iterations
- Tested on different levels of aggregation
- The goal is to keep the final model as simple, scalable and interpretable as possible.
- Tested Random Forest, XGboost, histogramClassifier
- Reported accuracies are from the Random forest model, but the other models had similar performance.

##  Next steps
1. Iterate and improve model accuracy for the poor performing classes.
2. Write validation and comparison schemes to examine model results at different scales of the detailed cadastre classification.




# Progress on imagery components


# Progress on stakeholder components

## Web application
- Developed an interactive web-application for the stakeholder engagement work
- We have a list of desirable features from all the presentations

---
