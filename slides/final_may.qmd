## Why urban fabric {.question}

Cities take up around 3% of the planet's land but are home to more than half of
humanity and responsible for 75% of carbon emissions^[United Nations (2020)].

## Why urban fabric {.question}

Urban fabric, [the spatial layout of the physical elements that make up a city]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}, mediates most
[activities]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} their residents undertake, from [heating]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} their homes to accessing [services]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}, [jobs and
opportunities]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}  through sustainable modes of [transport]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}.

## Why urban fabric {.question}

Easily available, comparable, and dynamic information on urban fabric would unlock new ways
of understanding how cities are constantly [evolving]{.fragment .highlight-red}, what it means for their [sustainability]{.fragment .highlight-red}, and
how effective [policies]{.fragment .highlight-red} can be designed to steer development in desirable directions.

## Why now {.question}

In 2023, UN Habitat included urban
fabric as one of the [key ingredients]{.fragment .highlight-red} required for effective sustainable design^[UN Habitat (2024)]

## Why now {.question}

There are currently very few instances of [detailed]{.fragment .highlight-red}, [consistent]{.fragment .highlight-red}, and [scalable]{.fragment .highlight-red} measurements of urban fabric and virtually none of them provide insight into its change over [time]{.fragment .highlight-red}.

## EuroFab vision

EuroFab paves the road for a world where stakeholders, from local authorities to supranational organisations, are able to track and monitor the pattern of urban development in detail directly relevant for planning and at scale.

## Objectives

---

### Technical objectives

1. Specify, [develop]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}, and validate innovative [methods]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} integrating raster ([satellite]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}) and [vector]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} data in rich and explainable [characterisations of urban fabric]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}.

---

### Technical objectives

2. Test the comparative performance of [transformer]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}-based (foundation) vision models against the baseline of [convolution]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}-based neural networks.

---

### Technical objectives

3. [Evaluate]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} the selected models on two European regions.

---

### Technical objectives

4. Develop open-source [software]{.fragment .highlight-red}, [algorithms]{.fragment .highlight-red} and open [datasets]{.fragment .highlight-red} that ensure the sustainability and usability of the project outputs beyond the initial funding period.

---

### Technical objectives

5. Create the [roadmap]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} for a [large-scale inference chain]{.fragment .highlight-current-red} (i.e. covering all of Europe or parts of the globe) for the capability being developed.

# AI vision model

## Approach

## Spatial signatures as ground truth data

* Spatial signatures framework (Arribas-Bel & Fleischmann 2022)
* Proxy due to its conceptual alignment with the morphometric model

# Future work

The overarching strategy for scaling and productionalising the EuroFab system involves three principal phases.

---

## European classification of Urban Fabric

Using the morphometric pipeline to generate detailed urban classification at a pan-European scale.

---

### Challenges & Strategy

* **Alignment with Cadastral Classification**

* **Heterogenous data sources**

* **Data Gaps**

* **Unknown urban fabric types**

* **Model Tuning and Optimisation**


---

## European classification of Urban Fabric across time (AI model)


Training the AI vision model on the outputs from step one, to fill data gaps and to produce a temporal classification based on historical satellite data.

---

### Challenges & Strategy

* **Leveraging Copernicus Services**

* **Leveraging the new morphometric classification results as ground truth**

* **Generalisability Testing**:

* **Evaluation of urban predictions across time**

* **Methodological processing**

---

## Expanded Stakeholder engagement

Third, productising the refined classification results and expanding stakeholder engagement activities. This will be crucial for driving user adoption and facilitating the derivation of secondary indicators and specialised datasets tailored to specific applications, such as regional development analysis or climate change impact assessments.

---

### Challenges & Strategy

*  **Workshops and conference work**

*  **Closer Engagement with Specific Cities and Regions**

*  **Collaborations & co-development**

* **Developing derived products**

* **Supporting Third-Party Development of Derived Products**
