## Spatial signatures as ground truth data

* Spatial signatures framework (Arribas-Bel & Fleischmann 2022)
* Proxy due to its conceptual alignment with the morphometric model

# Future work

The overarching strategy for scaling and productionalising the EuroFab system involves three principal phases.

---

## European classification of Urban Fabric 

Using the morphometric pipeline to generate detailed urban classification at a pan-European scale. 

---

### Challenges & Strategy

* **Alignment with Cadastral Classification**

* **Heterogenous data sources**

* **Data Gaps** 

* **Unknown urban fabric types**

* **Model Tuning and Optimisation** 


---

## European classification of Urban Fabric across time (AI model)


Training the AI vision model on the outputs from step one, to fill data gaps and to produce a temporal classification based on historical satellite data. 

---

### Challenges & Strategy

* **Leveraging Copernicus Services** 

* **Leveraging the new morphometric classification results as ground truth**

* **Generalisability Testing**:

* **Evaluation of urban predictions across time**

* **Methodological processing**

---

## Expanded Stakeholder engagement

Third, productising the refined classification results and expanding stakeholder engagement activities. This will be crucial for driving user adoption and facilitating the derivation of secondary indicators and specialised datasets tailored to specific applications, such as regional development analysis or climate change impact assessments.

---

### Challenges & Strategy

*  **Workshops and conference work**

*  **Closer Engagement with Specific Cities and Regions**

*  **Collaborations & co-development** 

* **Developing derived products** 

* **Supporting Third-Party Development of Derived Products**
