# Technical Note D3 - Reference Data Selection

## Morphological data

1. Morphometric classification of Central Europe (UPDATE)
2. Microsoft Building footprints
3. Overture Maps streets
4. Implementation

---

### Morphometric classification of Central Europe
- It is based on cadastre building data (NEW) !
    - Processed from official APIs for all five countries
    - New data has ~11 million more buildings than EUBUCCO
    - Quality checks are still pending
- Uses Overture streets, therefore there will be some shared data between the classifications, making the model inference easier

---

![Example detailed classification](../figures/milestone_december/prague_400.png)

---

### Problems with existing datasets - EUBUCCO, etc..

![Lots of missing and undocumented processed data](../figures/progress_october/bubenec.png)
 
---

### Problems with cadastre data - Germany, Poland, etc..

![Wrong and undocumented information - CRS, type, year, rate-limited APIs](../figures/progress_october/poland.png)

---

### Microsoft Building footprints
- Cover a large part of the globe - 1.5 billion building footprints.
- Available for the study region, whereas other sources such as Google footprints are not.
- Homogeneous origin - all footprints are derived using the same model.

---

### Examples

![Good coverage, but quality drops some places](../figures/milestone_december/building_comparison.png)

---



### Overture Maps streets
- OpenStreetMap data with minimal processing, therefore it has good coverage
- The ground truth morphometric classification uses it
- The street network is simplified, preserving its topology, but removing unnecassary clutter

## Satellite data



# Technical Note D2 - Algorithm Design and Theoretical Basis Description
## Morphometric Classification Homogenisation Protocol

---

### Protocol design

![Model protocol](../figures/milestone_december/workflow.png)

---

### Protocol design
1. Use morphometric classification of Central Europe from a parallel research project as ground truth data
2. Calculate morphometric characters on subpar, but homogenous and widely available data, using enclosed tessellation cells (ETCs) as the base unit of analysis

---

### Protocol design
3. Train a supervised model to predict the classification of ETCs directly from the calculated morphometric characters, using the morphometric classification data as a target label

---

### First iteration results
