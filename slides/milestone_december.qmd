# Introduction, status update

![Timeline](../figures/progress_august/gantchart.png)



# Technical Note D3
Reference Data Selection

## Morphological data

1. Morphometric classification of Central Europe (UPDATE)
2. Microsoft Building footprints
3. Overture Maps streets
4. Implementation

---

### Morphometric classification of Central Europe
- It is based on cadastre building data (NEW) !
    - Processed from official APIs for all five countries
    - New data has ~11 million more buildings than EUBUCCO
    - Quality checks are still pending
- Uses Overture streets, therefore there will be some shared data between the classifications, making the model inference easier

---

---

![Example coarser detailed classification](../figures/milestone_december/prague_600.png)

---

### Problems with existing datasets - EUBUCCO, etc..

![Lots of missing and undocumented processed data](../figures/progress_october/bubenec.png)

---

### Problems with cadastre data - Germany, Poland, etc..

![Wrong and undocumented information - CRS, type, year, rate-limited APIs](../figures/progress_october/poland.png)

---

### Microsoft Building footprints
- Cover a large part of the globe - 1.5 billion building footprints.
- Available for the study region, whereas other sources such as Google footprints are not.
- Homogeneous origin - all footprints are derived using the same model.

---

### Examples

![Good coverage, but quality drops some places](../figures/milestone_december/building_comparison.png)

---



### Overture Maps streets
- OpenStreetMap data with minimal processing, therefore it has good coverage
- The ground truth morphometric classification uses it
- The street network is simplified, preserving its topology, but removing unnecassary clutter
---


### Examples
![Street processing](../figures/milestone_december/street_processing.png)

---

### Overall data
- Based on the preliminary results, there are 56,845,150 Microsoft building footprints for our study area, which are split into 474 subregions.
- This is significantly less than the available cadastre data, which has around 88 million buildings and are separated into 828 regions.
- The number of downloaded, unprocessed streets is similar to those in (Fleischmann and Samardzhiev Forthcoming) - 23,332,865


## Satellite data



# Technical Note D2
Algorithm Design and Theoretical Basis Description

## Morphometric Classification Homogenisation Protocol

---

### Protocol design

![Model protocol](../figures/milestone_december/workflow.png)

---

### Protocol design
1. Use morphometric classification of Central Europe from a parallel research project as ground truth data
2. Calculate morphometric characters on subpar, but homogenous and widely available data, using enclosed tessellation cells (ETCs) as the base unit of analysis

### Protocol design
3. Train a supervised model to predict the classification of ETCs directly from the calculated morphometric characters, using the morphometric classification data as a target label
