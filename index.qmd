## Project overview

The _“EuroFab: European Urban Fabric Classification using Artificial Intelligence”_
project brings an innovative perspective to understanding the
**structure of human settlements** by capturing their physical composition using explainable data science in
combination with Earth Observation (EO), and through state-of-the-art AI, uncovering their
temporal dimension.

Specifically, the solutions develop a two-step system combining
**mathematical characterisation of built-up fabric** using techniques known as urban
morphometrics, providing a rich hierarchical classification backed by rich interpretable
numerical descriptions, and state-of-the-art **neural networks** to recognise such classification
from open optical satellite imagery (**Sentinel 2**), allowing both the detection of individual types
in areas with ground data of lesser quality and the unfolding of such classification over time,
providing a unique temporal look at how human settlements evolve.

The  output
paves the way to map urban development in the European continent over both space and time,
covering every building from the smallest hamlet to the largest metropolis.

EuroFab helps
us understand the habitats we built and efficiently affect policy at European, national and local
levels ensuring the future of “urban” is sustainable, resilient and data driven.

The proposed project is an initiation of a more ambitious undertaking. It focuses on
developing scientific and technical solutions based on novel AI methods, in conjunction with
strategically shaping the outputs and framework to serve various stakeholders directly involved
in policy, planning, and research.
